    a. `git pull` in a jupyter terminal when you start working on something  
    b. `git status` to verify if there are changes  
    c. `git add <filename>` to add a file that you want to push onto github  
    d. `git commit -m "<write what changes you did in a short sentence>"` to label the changes  
    e. `git push` to actually upload them to github
